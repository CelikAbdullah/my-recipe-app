# MyRecipeApp

This is an Android app project to showcase concepts like
- MVVM pattern; Fragment -> ViewModel -> Repository -> Room or Retrofit
- Dependency Injection via Hilt 
- Paging Library 3 
- caching data via Android Room
- getting data from a server via Retrofit
- DataBinding
- Flow
- LiveData

I get the data from https://food2fork.ca/ .

### TODO: 
Next, I plan to add a detailed view to show each recipe in a more detailed fashion (like adding ingredients, etc.)
