# MyRecipeApp

This is an Android app project to showcase concepts like
- MVVM pattern; Fragment -> ViewModel -> Repository -> Room or Retrofit
- Dependency Injection via Hilt 
- Paging Library 3 
- caching data via Android Room
- getting data from a server via Retrofit

I get the data from https://food2fork.ca/ . 

## DEMO:


## TODO: 
Next, I plan to add a detailed view to show each recipe in a more detailed fashion (like adding ingredients, etc.)
